# Neural Latents

Neural latent models for online, real-time experiments.

## Overview

Neural latent models are a valuable tool for understanding and interpreting high-dimensional neural data in only a few dimensions. There are several models that are available for this, for example GLDS, PLDS, GPFA, LFADS, and XFADS.

Below is a list of models for analysis of neural latents.
